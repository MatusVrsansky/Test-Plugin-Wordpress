A theme called Qusq Lite.

== Description ==

Hi. I'm Qusq Lite. I'm a unique colorful portfolio WordPress Theme with neat parallax effects, perfectly suitable for designer, freelancers, web-developers and creative teams. I am not a framework for building thousands of websites which all look the same. You get what you see and you can set-up your website quickly and easily in minutes. Do not expect any built-in drag & drop Page-Builders or more settings than a NASA space ship has. Qusq is a proper WordPress theme, with just the right amount of customisation options. Its power is in its simplicity and unique design.
